# deploy-rapidpro.xayma.sh

Deploy-Rapidpro
=========

This role is for deploying and managing a Rapidpro service and all its components (Django App, Celery, Mailroom, Indexer, Courier, Archiver, Redis, Postgres, Elasticsearch) with version 7.0.4 (only supported version for now).
It is intended to be used with the Ansible Tower and the Xayma.sh Platform already deployed (with all it's components).  
However if you want to use command create and manage odoo instances from the command line, with the Xayma.sh Platform already deployed, you can use the following:

```bash
ansible-playbook site.yml -i production --tags "deployrapidpro" --extra-vars "organization=xaymasolutions instancename=rapidpro domain=rapidpro.xaymasolutions.com" --vault-pass-file "vault_password" -K
```

> You need to know that when using the CLI way, the instance's addon folder will not be created by default and it might lead to some errors. In that situation you will need to create the addon folder manually.


Requirements
------------
- Deployment of the Xayma.sh Platform. Otherwise this is completely useless.
- Make sure to use the secret vault password `temba` ðŸ˜Ž. Can be a file (if you are using CLI) or a credential record in Ansible Tower.
